# PartsUnlimited 4.72 - repo as generated by https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/

You should not rely on this code for anything in production.  I made a copy of it so that I can use it for legacy training in case things get updated at the Azure Devops Demo Generator.

## Additional Info

At this point you should be working in .Net Core 3.1 or .Net 5.  There is an upgraded version of this code written in .Net Core, located here: https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited, although that version is likely in need of an update and will likely be updated soon (.Net Core 2.2 is no longer supported).

## Final thoughts

Again, this code is not intended for anything other than training purposes.  If you use this code for anything, you do so entirely at your own risk.
